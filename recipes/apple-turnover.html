    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This apple turnover recipe includes a delicious homemade filling that's baked inside flaky puff pastry triangles. I like to drizzle a sweet glaze on top when they are cooled or serve warm with vanilla ice cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>4 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed</li>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine lemon and 4 cups water in a large bowl. Place the sliced apples in the water to keep them from browning.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Drain water from apples, and place them into the hot skillet. Cook and stir for about 2 minutes. Add brown sugar, and cinnamon, and cook, stirring, for 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir together cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water. Pour into the skillet and mix well. Cook for another minute, or until sauce has thickened. Remove from heat to cool slightly.</li>

        <li>Then cut each larger square into 4 smaller squares. Spoon apples onto the center of each square. Fold over from corner to corner into a triangle shape, and press edges together to seal.</li>
        <li>Place turnovers on a baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch between them. Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until turnovers are puffed and lightly browned. Cool completely before glazing.</li>
        <li>To make the glaze: Mix confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla together in a small bowl. Adjust the thickness by adding more sugar or milk if necessary. Drizzle glaze over the cooled turnovers.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
