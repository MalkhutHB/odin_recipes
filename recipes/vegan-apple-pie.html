    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a delicious apple pie recipe. Made with no animal 
        products, the crust is very buttery and light. Serve right 
        out of the oven, chilled, or warmed</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Crust:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®)</li> 
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®)</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup rice milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>7 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup vegan margarine, 1 tablespoon white sugar, and salt in a food processor; pulse until mixture clumps together. Pour water in slowly and pulse a few times until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a flat work surface; knead for 30 seconds and shape into a disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Dust a flat work surface with flour. Roll dough out into two 10-inch crusts. Press 1 crust gently into a 9-inch pie plate.</li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, 1/2 cup vegan margarine, 1/4 cup white sugar, rice milk, 3 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until margarine melts and brown sugar is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place apple slices in a large bowl. Pour brown sugar mixture on top; mix until apples are evenly coated. Pile apples into the bottom crust. Cover with second crust. Cut slits in the top crust with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and apples are semitranslucent, 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
